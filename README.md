introducing the powRballad package
----------------------------------

This package solves the most fundamental problem we all have when we walk into a kareokebar after UseR;

> what song to pick?

The powRballad package helps you in selecting the most optimal song based on you R-skill and Nationality.

It has one function: `select_powerballad()`

adding to this package
----------------------

If you feel like we missed a critical powerballad or misspelled something (likely) add it to the textfile which can be found in <inst/extdata/powerballads.txt> if you add more then one song, add yourself to the description file as well. use this format:

`person("firstname","lastname", role = "ctb")` *ctb means contributor*
