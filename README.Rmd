## Introducing the powRballad package

This package solves the most fundamental problem we all have
when we walk into a kareokebar after UseR;

> what song to pick?

The powRballad package helps you in selecting the most optimal song based
on you R-skill and Nationality.

It has one function: `select_powerballad()`


## How to install

If you don' have devtools installed:
'install.packages('devtools')'

Install from github with 

```
library(devtools)
install_github('reoke/powrballad')
```


## adding to this package
If you feel like we missed a critical powerballad or misspelled something (likely) add it to 
the textfile which can be found in [inst/extdata/powerballads.txt](inst/extdata/powerballads.txt)
if you add more then one song, add yourself to the description file as well. use this format:

`person("firstname","lastname", role = "ctb")` *ctb means contributor*
